# Signal Multicast Bot

This project makes use of a Postgres database and [signal-cli](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli)
to create a service similar to what moderated mailing lists provided some years ago, but on Signal: 

- administrators create lists
- users subscribe to them or are added by administrators
- administrators send messages which are distributed to all subscribers

Signal already has groups, but this is made for announcement-like communication. The users
don't know who else is on the list, and everyone gets the messages in a one-to-one chat.

### Bot commands

#### Basic (everyone can send these commands to the bot)
```
bot help
bot subscribe <GROUPNAME> <PARTICIPANT NAME>
bot unsubscribe <GROUPNAME>
```

#### Administrative (only select people can use these commands)

```
bot listgroups
bot addgroup <GROUPNAME>
bot removegroup <GROUPNAME>
bot list <GROUPNAME>
bot add <GROUPNAME> <PARTICIPANT PHONE NUMBER WITHOUT SPACES> <PARTICIPANT NAME>
bot remove <GROUPNAME> <PARTICIPANT NAME OR NUMBER>
bot send <GROUPNAME> <SOME TEXT>
```

#### Examples

```
bot subscribe Testgroup Steven Miller
bot addgroup Testgroup
bot add Testgroup 017912345678 Some Dude
bot send Testgroup This message should be sent!
```

### Get started

1. If you don't have a [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org) instance yet, create one.
2. If you don't run [signal-cli as DBus service](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli/wiki/DBus-service)
   yet, set it up now.
3. Checkout this project to your computer (or just copy `main.py`, `database.py` and `config-template.ini`).
4. Copy `config-template.ini` to `config.ini` and edit it so it contains 
   the phone number(s) you want to use and the correct database credentials.
5. Call `main.py` with at least Python 3.6 installed.
